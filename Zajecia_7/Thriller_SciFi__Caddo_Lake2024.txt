The story centers on Ellie, a teenager who frequently fights with her mother and has left home to stay with a friend. There is also Paris, a man in his twenties who was in the car with his mother when she drove off a bridge. While she died, he managed to escape.

Ellie lives near Caddo Lake, a mysterious body of water that straddles the Louisiana-Texas border, with her mother, stepfather, and eight-year-old stepsister, Anna. One night, Anna vanishes while near the lake, prompting a search by the family and community. During her search, Ellie heads to a portion of the lake where the water has receded enough for her to walk on the now-dry lake bed. When she returns home, she discovers that she has gone back three days in time. In a panic, she rushes back to the lake and finds Anna, but this is one month in the past when Anna had previously run off. It turns out that Caddo Lake has a time displacement phenomenon that activates when the water levels drop. Determined, Ellie returns to the lake in hopes of finding Anna once more.

Meanwhile, Paris is trying to uncover the reason for his mother's seizure that led to the car accident. He works dredging the lake and experiences something strange: he sees footprints on the dry lake bed and suddenly loses his hearing. When he returns to his boat, he discovers a necklace stuck in the motor. It is the same necklace that belonged to his mother. Paris's former girlfriend comes back into his life, and they rekindle their relationship; however, she is skeptical of his claims about the lake's mystery.

The stories converge when Paris returns to the lake and goes through portals that transport him to 1952. There, he finds a wounded Anna and helps her before trying to return to his own time in 2003. Instead, he ends up in 2022, the present time for Ellie.

In 2022, Ellie travels to 2005 and, while in a grocery store parking lot, she sees a necklace dangling from a car mirror that resembles her mother's necklace. This necklace belonged to Anna when she went missing. Desperate to retrieve it, Ellie breaks into the car just as the owner arrives and attacks her, trying to get the necklace back. She asks where the necklace came from, and the woman reveals that it belonged to her missing boyfriend's mother, Anna Lang. Ellie realizes that the woman is her mother, Celeste, and the baby she is holding is Ellie herself. Shocked, Ellie runs off to find an internet cafe. There, she looks up Anna Lang and discovers old photos, realizing that her stepsister Anna is actually her grandmother. Determined, she heads back to the lake to return home.

Meanwhile, in 2022, Paris is discovered in Ellie's boat, which she had tied up before traveling to the past. He is arrested as a suspect in Anna's disappearance. Seeing a news report that features a photo of Anna, he realizes that the girl he saved in the past was his mother. He manages to escape from the police but tragically drowns while trying to return through the portal to get home.

Upon returning to 2022, Ellie comes to the realization that her stepfather, with whom she has been fighting, is her great-grandfather. She arrives home to find her mother in shock, watching a news report about Paris's escape and death. The report contains a photo of Paris, and authorities are asking for help in identifying him. Ellie then shows her mother Anna's school picture from 1952 and embraces her, explaining that neither Anna nor Paris intended to leave them.
